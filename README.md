# Network-Virtual-Lab-Portfolio
Welcome to my Network Technology Portfolio! This repository is where I organize and showcase my skills and knowledge in network systems and technology as I progress through my course. By building and updating my portfolio here, I can highlight my hands-on experience in areas such as network design, security, troubleshooting, and other key aspects of network technology.

## Purpose

Creating this Network Technology Portfolio allows me to demonstrate what I’ve learned, how I’ve applied my skills in real projects, and my ability to solve networking problems. It’s a useful tool for job applications, internships, or simply tracking my professional growth. As I gain more experience, my portfolio will grow, showing my ability to adapt to new technologies and challenges in networking.

In today’s tech-driven world, having a clear and organized portfolio gives me an edge, showing future employers or collaborators my practical skills and expertise.

## Walkthroughs

For each lab I complete, I will create a written or video walkthrough and include it in this repository. When writing a walkthrough, I consider the following:

- **Objective:** Clearly state the purpose and goals of the lab.
- **Challenges:** Document any hardships or obstacles I faced and how I overcame them.
- **Documentation:** Include screenshots, diagrams, or code as needed for clarity.
- **Learning Outcomes:** Summarize what I learned and any new skills I gained.


I’ll keep my portfolio updated as I complete new labs and projects. This will help me track my growth and show my evolving expertise in the field of network technology.
